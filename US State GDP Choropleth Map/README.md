US State GDP Choropleth Map

Lab 4

##### Project Description

The purpose of this application is to display the GDP of the American states in a readable format. The data comes from a credible US government agency that monitors economic data. The way I chose to portray this data is in the form of a choropleth map. This is because I felt that proportional symbols wouldn't consistently represent that relative differences of states, and in some cases be more misleading than a choropleth map in the sizes of states with a relatively massive GDP such as California. I also chose to represent the colors in a way that made states with relatively smaller GDPs have more range of colors, because if I made it completely linear, the majority of the states in the US would only appear at the lowest value instead of having the range and distinction that we can see in the final product. I chose green as the color for the map because green means money in most people's minds.
